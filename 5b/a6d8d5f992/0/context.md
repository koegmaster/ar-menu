## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

We are currently planing to implement virtual menus for smaller restaurants. The plan is to provide a service to the restaurants to digitize the menus and even provide the food items in augemented reality for the restaurant customers. For that we need a application where we can upload a few picture of a dish, and then it is converted into a 3d model.

### Prompt 2

### Prompt 3

next we want to host those models somewhere so we can provide it to the users. Best case we have some qr codes in the restaurants for the menu, and people can directly show the dishes in AR with their phones, e.g. this could be possible via progressive web apps or any other method that is feasible and seamless for the restaurant customers

### Prompt 4
