The inital app looks quiet ok, but to further improve the setup I would need to have the admin page behind a authenticatian and authorization layer, as currently everyone could see and use the data we upload. Another thing we need to take care about is that the 3d models created are way to big. we upload pictures of standard dishes on plates, and in AR they are as big as a table, so the scaling needs to be done properly.

yes please implment the plan now
